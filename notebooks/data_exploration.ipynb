DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: A group-based treatment programme was intended to increase the awareness of how attitudes, habits and bodily practices are established, developed, and can be transformed, and thereby probably reduce pain. A single case story from this treatment programme is presented. A semi-structured interview was conducted with all participants about their experiences after completion of the programme. All eight women reported that they had benefited from participation. From these interviews a single case was chosen to represent the study's findings. A narrative analysis was conducted, focusing this patient's story from a phenomenological understanding of the body. RESULTS: The patient's story illuminates how events and experiences can be connected, and how she interprets her contemporary situation in the light of previous experiences. In this way, she alters her understanding and develops a new approach to her situation. Her story demonstrated how symptoms can be understood as the result of stressful habits that the body has developed as a reaction to demands from the surroundings. CONCLUSIONS: Reflection on how the body functions may lead to a new realization of how phenomena are interconnected, thus making changes possible.\", '\"Green Vanilla Tea is a true story of love and courage in the face of a deadly and little understood illness. With literary finesse, compassion, and a powerful gift of storytelling, Marie Williams writes poignantly of her husband Dominic\\'s struggles with early onset dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of 40, and how their family found hope amidst the wreckage of a mysterious neurological condition. As the condition develops and progresses, the normally devoted family man and loving partner seems to disappear beneath an expressionless facade, erratic behavior, and a relentless desire to wander that often leaves him lost. The road to diagnosis is long and confusing, and what starts off as perplexing for the family then becomes frightening. The man they love is changing, and no one seems to know why. He no longer turns up to his sons\\' high school events. He falls and bumps into things. He becomes verbally disinhibited, emotionally disengaged, and, at times, belligerent. He doesn\\'t seem to be able to read the social cues of other people. He gets lost in familiar places, as well as on obsessive work trips overseas. He recklessly spends the family money, leaving them in near financial ruin. Despite this, Williams and her children strive to find new ways to keep him safe and to connect with the husband and father they love so dearly. While the family learns to cope with Dominic\\'s illness-which they call the Green Goblin-Williams is determined that her children reclaim the dad of their memories. She finds creative ways to make visible the stories of the man beyond the illness, and helps them remember him as the engaged, healthy, and loving man she fell in love with. She humanizes the experience through storytelling and assembling a quilt made up of transferred photographs, painted artwork, family footprints, and personal inscriptions from family and friends. This, along with tea rituals, music, and stories of fatherhood, love and value, support them as fierce advocates for Dominic\\'s dignity and give the family new ways to be together as they journey through his decline. Spanning between moments of intense joy and incredible sadness, this book is a passionate testament to one family\\'s unconditional love for one another. It is, \"a tale of a strange place-the real world- in which green goblins and hope find a way to live together.\" Above all, it is a love story\"--', '\"This is the first book of its kind to include the personal accounts of people who have survived injury to the brain, along with professional therapists\\' reports of their progress through rehabilitation. The paintings and stories of survivors combine with experts\\' discussions of the theory and practice of brain injury rehabilitation to illustrate the ups and downs that survivors encounter in their journey from pre-injury status to insult and post-injury rehabilitation. Wilson, Winegardner and Ashworth\\'s focus on the survivors\\' perspective shows how rehabilitation is an interactive process between people with brain injury, health care staff, and others, and gives the survivors the chance to tell their own stories of life before their injury, the nature of the insult, their early treatment, and subsequent rehabilitation.Presenting practical approaches to help survivors of brain injury achieve functionally relevant and meaningful goals, Life After Brain Injury: Survivors Stories will help all those working in rehabilitation understand the principles involved in holistic brain injury rehabilitation and how these principles, combined with theory and models, translate into clinical practice. This book will be of great interest to anyone who wishes to extend their knowledge of the latest theories and practices involved in making life more manageable for people who have suffered damage to the brain.

This book is a testament to the complexity of vision and the brain and to the power of creativity and adaptation, and it provides a whole new perspective on the power of language and communication, as we try to imagine what it is to perceive through another person's eyes, or another person's mind.\", \"Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience have suggested that the integration of information about the internal bodily state and the external environment is crucial for the experience of emotion. Extensive overlap between the neural mechanisms underlying the subjective emotion and those involved in interoception (perception of that which is arising from inside the body) has been identified. However, the mechanisms of interaction between the neural substrates of interoception and emotional experience remain unclear. We examined the common and distinct features of the neural activity underlying evaluation of emotional and bodily state using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The right anterior insular cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) were identified as commonly activated areas. As both of these areas are considered critical for interoceptive awareness, these results suggest that attending to the bodily state underlies awareness of one's emotional state. Uniquely activated areas involved in the evaluation of emotional state included the temporal pole, posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Also the precuneus was functionally associated with activity of the right anterior insular cortex and VMPFC when evaluating emotional state. Our findings indicate that activation in these areas and the precuneus are functionally associated for accessing interoceptive information and underpinning subjective experience of the emotional state. Thus, awareness of one's own emotional state appears to involve the integration of interoceptive information with an interpretation of the current situation.\"]\n",

      "5 samples: ['Violence and aggression is common in psychiatric inpatient units. Despite the near universal prevalence of restraint, there is very little published research on either the efficacy or the subjective effects of restraint on staff or patients. In this pilot study, semistructured interviews were given to the patients and staff involved in six untoward incidents in which the patient participant had been subject to manual physical restraint. Participants were interviewed as soon as possible after the occurrence of the incidents. The interviews asked the patient and staff participants to identify and discuss the factors that they found helpful and unhelpful during and in the immediate aftermath of these incidents. The incidents generated strong emotions for all concerned. The patients valued staff time and attention but felt that they received too little attention. Both nurses and patients discriminated between permanent and temporary staff. Patients reported feeling upset, distressed and ignored prior to the incidents and isolated and ashamed afterwards. Postincident debriefing was valued by all but was patchy for staff and rarer still for patients. Patients feared the possibility of being restrained. Half of the patients and several staff members reported that the incidents had reawakened distressing memories of previous traumatic events. Further research on the subjective effects of restraint is urgently needed.', 'Autobiographical reminiscences of first Indian professor of medicine and his contribution in medical education.', 'Fifty-two subjects with panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were interviewed 12-18 months after they completed an acute treatment study (9-11 weeks) with alprazolam followed by blind and controlled drug discontinuation. Patients were questioned about the severity of their anxiety disorder and degree of functional impairment at the time of follow-up, as well as about their subjective experience as participants in a clinical trial. At the time of follow-up 78% of the patients reported none or minimal anxiety symptoms and 89% had none or only minimal functional deficit, as compared to 100% reporting moderate to severe anxiety symptoms and 57% reporting significant functional deficit before entering the study. Overall, patients felt that the participation in the study was a very positive and beneficial experience and 64% said they would not hesitate to participate in a clinical trial in the future.', \"BACKGROUND: While psychiatric literature has shown renewed interest in fine psychopathological investigation, little study has been devoted to the clinician's subjective experience with the patient, which is highly valued by the phenomenological and psychodynamic traditions. We aimed at developing a valid and reliable instrument to measure such experience. SAMPLING AND METHODS: First, 104 self-report items were developed, based on daily clinical practice and references from the literature on clinician's subjective experience. Of these, 46 were retained after pilot testing and exclusion of items with poor psychometric properties. Thirteen psychiatrists and 527 first-contact patients participated in the validation study. Psychiatrists completed the 'Assessment of Clinician's Subjective Experience' (ACSE) instrument and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) after the visit and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) before and after it. The ACSE was completed again for 60 patients with stable BPRS scores over a short retest interval. Principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation was performed. The internal consistency and test-retest stability of ACSE factorially derived scales were calculated. Convergent validity was tested by examining the correlations between ACSE scores and change in POMS scores during the visit. RESULTS: Five factors (interpreted as tension, difficulty of attunement, engagement, disconfirmation, impotence) accounting for 57% of total variance were extracted. All ACSE scales showed high internal consistency and stability, and correlated with conceptually related POMS scales. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of subjective experience identified by the ACSE is consistent with classical psychopathological descriptions and previous related studies. Despite limitations such as the relatively small number of psychiatrists studied and the exclusively self-report nature of the instrument, this study supports the validity and reliability of the ACSE and suggests that it may be a valuable tool for training, research and possibly diagnostic purposes.\", '\"This memoir recounts one man\\'s experience when he became afflicted by electrical and multiple chemical sensitivities in his line of work as an engineer.
